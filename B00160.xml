            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>IN <hi>London</hi> dwelt a Marchant man,</l>
            <l>that left unto his Sonne,</l>
            <l>A thouſand pound in Land a yere,</l>
            <l>to ſpend when he was gone:</l>
            <l>With coffer crambd with golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crownes</l>
            <l>moſt like a Father kinde.</l>
            <l>To haue him follow his owne ſteps,</l>
            <l>and beare the ſelfeſame mind.</l>
            <l>Thus euery man doth know, doth know,</l>
            <l>and his beginning ſee,</l>
            <l>But none ſo wiſe can ſhew, can ſhew,</l>
            <l>what will his ending be.</l>
            <l>No ſooner was his father dead,</l>
            <l>and clozed in his graue.</l>
            <l>But this his wilde and wanton ſonne,</l>
            <l>his minde to lewdneſſe gaue.</l>
            <l>And being but of tender yeares.</l>
            <l>found out ſuch companie,</l>
            <l>Which prou'd his fatall ouerthrow,</l>
            <l>and finall miſerie.</l>
            <l>In gluttonny and drunkenneſſe,</l>
            <l>he daily took delght,</l>
            <l>And ſtill in Strmpets company,</l>
            <l>he ſpent the ſilent night:</l>
            <l>Forgetting quite that drunkeneſſe.</l>
            <l>and filthy lechery,</l>
            <l>Of all the ſinnes will ſooneſt bring</l>
            <l>a man to miſerie.</l>
            <l>Within the Seas of wanton loue,</l>
            <l>his heart was drownde ſo deep.</l>
            <l>A night he could not quietly</l>
            <l>without ſtrange women ſleep.</l>
            <l>And therefore kept them ſecretly,</l>
            <l>to feed his foule deſire,</l>
            <l>Apparell'd all like gallant youthes</l>
            <l>in Pages trimme attyre.</l>
            <l>Their garments were of Crimſon ſilke,</l>
            <l>bedect with lace of gold,</l>
            <l>Their curled haire was white as milke,</l>
            <l>moſt comely to be hold.</l>
            <l>He gaue them for their Cognizance,</l>
            <l>a Purple bléeding heart,</l>
            <l>In which two ſiluer arrowes ſéemed,</l>
            <l>the ſame in twaine to part.</l>
            <l>Thus ſecret were his wanton ſports,</l>
            <l>thus priuate was his pleaſure,</l>
            <l>Thus Harlots in the ſhape of men,</l>
            <l>did waſt away his treaſure.</l>
            <l>Oh woe to luſt and lecherie,</l>
            <l>oh woe to ſuch a vice</l>
            <l>That buyes repentance all too late,</l>
            <l>and at too deare a price,</l>
            <l>Yet he repented not at all,</l>
            <l>ſo wilfull was his mind,</l>
            <l>He could not ſee his infamy,</l>
            <l>for ſin had made him blind.</l>
            <l>But in his heart defir'd a change</l>
            <l>of wanton pleaſures ſo,</l>
            <l>That day by day he wiſhes ſtill,</l>
            <l>ſtrange women for to know.</l>
            <l>And ſo diſcharging of his traine,</l>
            <l>and ſelling of his land.</l>
            <l>To trauell into countries ſtrange,</l>
            <l>he quickly took in hand,</l>
            <l>And into <hi>Antwerpe</hi> ſpeedily,</l>
            <l>thus all aflaunt he goes,</l>
            <l>To ſee the dainty Flemiſh Girles,</l>
            <l>and gallant Dutchland Froes.</l>
            <l>For ſtill, quoth he the Dutchland Froes,</l>
            <l>are kinde to Engliſhmen.</l>
            <l>Ile haue my pleaſure of thoſe Girles,</l>
            <l>or neuer come againe:</l>
            <l>And being arriu'd in <hi>Antwerpe</hi> ſtreets,</l>
            <l>he met a louely Dame,</l>
            <l>That was a Widowes daughter deare,</l>
            <l>of good report and fame.</l>
            <l>Her beauty like the Purple roſe,</l>
            <l>ſo gliſtered in his eye,</l>
            <l>That rauiſht with the ſame, he crau'd</l>
            <l>her ſecret company.</l>
            <l>But ſhe like to an honeſt Maid.</l>
            <l>by no meanes would conſent,</l>
            <l>To ſatisfie his luſtfull eye,</l>
            <l>as was his falle intent,</l>
            <l>A hundred dayes he wholly ſpent.</l>
            <l>as many nights in vaine,</l>
            <l>As many angels he conſum'd,</l>
            <l>Her maiden-head to gaine.</l>
            <l>But nothing he preuaild at all,</l>
            <l>untill that Satans aid,</l>
            <l>And curſed counſell helping him,</l>
            <l>for to deflowre this maid.</l>
            <l>For like a luſtfull Lecher he,</l>
            <l>found ſuch conuenient time,</l>
            <l>That he inforced her to drink,</l>
            <l>till ſhe was drunk with wine,</l>
            <l>And being ouerchargd with wine,</l>
            <l>as Maidens heads be meake:</l>
            <l>He rauiſht her there, when that ſhe</l>
            <l>could no reſiſtance make.</l>
            <l>For being ſenceleſſe there ſhe loſt</l>
            <l>her ſweet virginity,</l>
            <l>Which ſhe had kept full twenty yeares,</l>
            <l>with great ſeuerity,</l>
            <l>Therefore good Virgins take good heed</l>
            <l>leſt you be thus beguild.</l>
            <l>When Wine is ſettled in your braine,</l>
            <l>you may be got with Child.</l>
            <l>And marke, I pray what then befell,</l>
            <l>unto this modeſt Dame:</l>
            <l>When ſhe recouered her loſt ſence</l>
            <l>and knew of her defame,</l>
            <l>In pining grief, ſhe languiſht long.</l>
            <l>like <hi>Philomel</hi> by night</l>
            <l>And would not come for very ſhame,</l>
            <l>in honeſt Maidens ſight:</l>
            <l>Her wombe at laſt began to ſwell,</l>
            <l>her Babe receiued life:</l>
            <l>And being neither Widow nor Maid,</l>
            <l>nor yet a maried Wife,</l>
            <l>Did wiſh that ſhe had nere been borne.</l>
            <l>but in her Cradle dy'd.</l>
            <l>Then Angels at the gate of Heauen,</l>
            <l>had crownd her Virgin bright.</l>
            <l>This Babe that breedeth in my wombe,</l>
            <l>(quoth ſhe) ſhall nere be borne,</l>
            <l>Nor call'd a baſtard by ſuch wiues,</l>
            <l>that hold ſuch loue in ſcorne:</l>
            <l>For I a Strumpet in diſgrace,</l>
            <l>though one againſt my will,</l>
            <l>Before I will ſo ſhame my friends,</l>
            <l>my deare liues bloud Ile ſpill.</l>
            <l>For as with wine I was deceiu'd</l>
            <l>and made a vitious Dame,</l>
            <l>So will I waſh away with Wine</l>
            <l>my ſcar et ſpots of ſhame.</l>
            <l>Then drinking up her burning Wine,</l>
            <l>ſhe yeelded up her breath,</l>
            <l>By which likewiſe the unborne Babe,</l>
            <l>was ſcalded unto death.</l>
            <l>Her Mother falling on her knees</l>
            <l>to heauen did cry and call,</l>
            <l>If euer Widowes curſe quoth ſhe,</l>
            <l>on mortall man did fall,</l>
            <l>Then ſay, Amen to mine O Lord</l>
            <l>that he may neuer thriue.</l>
            <l>That was the cauſe of this miſchance,</l>
            <l>but rot away aliue.</l>
            <l>His nailes from off his fingers dropt,</l>
            <l>his eyes from out his head.</l>
            <l>His toes they roted from his feet,</l>
            <l>before that he was dead,</l>
            <l>His tongue that had falſe-ſworne ſo oft,</l>
            <l>to compaſſe his deſire</l>
            <l>Within his mouth doth glow and burne,</l>
            <l>like coales of ſparkling fire:</l>
            <l>And thus in torment in his ſinne,</l>
            <l>this wicked Caitife dyd,</l>
            <l>Whoſe hatefull Carkes after death.</l>
            <l>in earth could not abide,</l>
            <l>But in the mawes of Carrion Crowes,</l>
            <l>and Rauens made a Tombe,</l>
